## Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring and understanding a dataset through various techniques of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of funding received by Indian setup. The objective is to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions through summary statistics and graphical representations.

## Dataset Information
- **Source**: [Link to dataset](dataset_link) We merge 4 datasets; 1 from github, 2 from a database and 1 from a google rive.
- **Description**: Brief description of the dataset (e.g., size, number of features, etc.) Our data had columns like company name, what the company does, year starup was founded, investors, funding amount received, etc.
- **Features**: The merged data set had about 2899 rows and 10 columns
  - `feature_1`: Description of feature 1
  - `feature_2`: Description of feature 2
  - `...`

## Objectives

The main objectives of this EDA project are:

1. To understand the structure of the dataset.
2. To clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
3. To perform visualizations to detect trends, relationships, and patterns.
4. To extract key insights and provide a summary report.

## Libraries and Tools Used

- **Python Version**: 3.x
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
  - `numpy`: Numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: Data visualization
  - `scipy`: Statistical analysis
  - `missingno`: Visualizing missing data

## EDA Process

### Data Cleaning

- Handled missing values
- Removed duplicates
- Feature engineering (if applicable)
- Outlier detection and removal

### Data Visualization

- Univariate analysis (e.g., histograms, box plots)
- Bivariate analysis (e.g., scatter plots, correlation heatmaps)
- Multivariate analysis (e.g., pair plots, 3D plots)

### Statistical Analysis

- Descriptive statistics
- Correlation analysis
- Hypothesis testing (if applicable)

## Key Insights

- Insight 1: [Briefly describe a key finding]
- Insight 2: [Briefly describe another finding]
- Insight 3: [And so on...]

## Future Work

- Perform feature engineering for predictive modeling.
- Test additional statistical methods for more robust insights.
- Apply this EDA on a larger or more recent dataset for validation.
